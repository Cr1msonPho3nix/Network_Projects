# Scenario
You are a security analyst working for a social media organization. The organization recently experienced a major data breach, which compromised the safety of their customers’ personal information, such as names and addresses. Your organization wants to implement strong network hardening practices that can be performed consistently to prevent attacks and breaches in the future.

After inspecting the organization’s network, you discover four major vulnerabilities. The four vulnerabilities are as follows:
- The organization’s employees' share passwords.
- The admin password for the database is set to the default.
- The firewalls do not have rules in place to filter traffic coming in and out of the network.
- Multifactor authentication (MFA) is not used.

If no action is taken to address these vulnerabilities, the organization is at risk of experiencing another data breach or other attacks in the future.

## 1. Select up to three hardening tools and methods to implement:

- Password Policies.
- Multifactor Authentication (MFA).
- Base Configurations and Firewall Maintenance (both related).

## 2. Explain your recommendations
- A Multifactor authentication (MFA) implementation would cut two of vulnerabilities described, share passwords and not using this measure.
With this rule applied employees can't share the access to their account cause they need biometric authentication or a device, such as their phones, to access.

- Base configurations and Firewall maintenance are two related measures that would fix the firewall of not having rules to filter traffic.

- Password policies is a measure that can prevent the database's password to be set to default. This can also be applied to the employees passwords on top of the MFA measure to ensure another layer of protection.
